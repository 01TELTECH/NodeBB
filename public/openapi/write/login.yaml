  summary: verify login credentials
  description: |
    This route accepts a username/password or email/password pair (dependent on forum settings), returning a standard user object if credentials are validated successfully.
    This route also initializes a standard login session and returns a valid cookie that can be used in subsequent API calls as though it were a browser session.
    **Note**: Cookie-based sessions require a CSRF token for non-`GET` routes.

    `username` and `password` are expected to be passed in to this call.
